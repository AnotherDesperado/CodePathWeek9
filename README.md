# CodePathWeek9

Used low-interaction honeypots in this assingment.

ISSUES: My <session.json> file exported empty at first, so I had to go back through the majority of the assignment to ensure that the Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP was installed on my honeypot.

Deployed a GCP Honeypot using Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP.

Recieved hundreds of attacks in seconds from multiple countries. USA, England, China-- the most seem to be from Lithuania.
